# Weight-Lifting-Activity-Recognition
Human activity recognition is growing in popularity, and diverging into a plethora of different uses. Here data was collected for the prediction of how well the subjects performed at doing prescribed exercises. Participants were asked to do dumbell exercises with accelerometers attached to the belt, forearm, arm and the dumbell itself. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). From the dataset generated a random forest model was generated to predict how accurate the exercise was being perforemed, exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). The resulting model was 99% accurate in classifying the performance of the exercise.
